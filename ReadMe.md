# GIT BASIC GUIDELINES FOR TEAM

# To pull changes from the main branch into your branch, you can follow these steps:>

1. Switch to your branch (if youâ€™re not on it already):
    ~ git checkout your-branch

2. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
    ~ git fetch origin

3. Merge changes from the main branch into your branch:
    ~ git merge origin/main

4. Resolve any conflicts if they arise, then commit the resolved changes.

After these steps, your branch will be up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch (if any).


# Check current branch
